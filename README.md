# The Impact of Housing Costs on Commuting and Transportation Choices in San Mateo County 2012-2022

# 📁 Description
This project investigates how rising housing costs have shaped commuting behavior and public transit reliance in San Mateo County over a decade. Using American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2012 to 2022, the analysis explores the intersections between housing affordability, income trends, rent burden, and commute durations.

# 🖇️ Research Question
- How have rising housing costs influenced residents' reliance on public transit and commute times?
- Do lower-income households face longer commute times?
- Is there a measurable relationship between commute duration and rent burden?

# 🛠️ Utility Belt
- Data Source: American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2012–2022)
- Metrics Analyzed: Median home value, rent, income, public transit usage, commute time, and rent burden
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), correlation analysis, visualizations

# 🔬 Key Findings
- Housing Costs: Home values more than doubled (from ~$700K to $1.3M) and rents increased by over 80% from 2012 to 2022.
- Transit Use: Public transit usage rose steadily until 2019 but dropped sharply post-pandemic, falling below 2012 levels by 2022.
- Commute Patterns: Commute times increased with housing prices until 2020, then decreased sharply due to remote work.
- Rent Burden: Remained high (~95–97%) across commute lengths, indicating commute time does not strongly predict rent burden.
- Income vs. Burden: Rent burden inversely correlated with income, showing that affordability remains a challenge despite rising wages.
